# Space-Mission-Design
Conduct First Order Sizing and Optimization for a Mission to store data in space

## Description
The requirement of the project was to make viable a mission to store data in space (above the cloud storage). This project requirement was created to reduce the cost of data storage and to force mission design to make a seemingly infeasable idea a profitable one. The sizing scripts here in MATLAB are used to optimize the design of the mission and resize different parts of the satellite itself.
